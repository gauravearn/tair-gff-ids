# tair_gff_ids
A set of functions which will provide easy access and cleaned gff from tair and uses a dataframe and datascience approach to get the systematic tair ids and their coordinates from the tair 10 gff version. It can be applied to any version of the tair for getting the systematic retrival of the tair ids. Download the tair 10 or any other gff3 version and use this to make a clean nested iterators of the genomic coordinates. it can be applied to any genomic annotation as long as the gff looks like the tair ones. This function is a part of the tairaccession package (pip install tairaccession), however you can use this separately and it is completely usable. \
